simple_receipt_form
===================
A Very basic PHP form I put together just for tracking my receipts during a trip so I wouldn't have to handle paper receipts
tracks
purchase name
purchase date submitted as yyyy-xx-dd
purchase value
purchase description (details)
method of payment (radio)
purchaser (radio)

The form is auto-generated using info from the database.
To add a field that takes a textfield input, use CHAR
To add a field that takes a pre-defined input (e.g. radios, checkbox, or Select drop downs) use varchar or any other data type
